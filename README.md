# Unofficial source code repository for Writing Secure Code, 2nd Edition

## Introducation

This is an unofficial source code repo for [Writing Secure Code, 2nd Ed](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/writing-secure-code-9780735617223) by David LeBlanc and Michael Howard. The source code is provided here simply for convenience (so you don't have to consult the physical media) and remains the copyright of the book authors.

Currently, this is the exact source code that came out of the download installer, but I'll be modernising it over time to use the latest VS version and Windows SDK target platform tools.
