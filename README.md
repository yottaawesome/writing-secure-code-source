# Unofficial source code repository for Writing Secure Code, 2nd Edition

## Introducation

This is an unofficial source code repo for [Writing Secure Code, 2nd Ed]](https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/writing-secure-code-9780735617223) by David LeBlanc and Michael Howard. Currently, this is the exact source code that came out of the download installer, but I'll be refactoring it over time to use the latest VS version and Windows SDK target platform.
